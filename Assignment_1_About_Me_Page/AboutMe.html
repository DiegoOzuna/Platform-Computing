        <p>
            Hello everyone, </br> <!--new line break-->
            My name is Diego Ozuna, I am a senior here at CSUSB and will graduate in December 2024.
            I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Since transfering, I have been on the Dean's
            List. I want to work closely with Machine Learning and AI which is why I am interested mostly in the field of Data Science.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies are film photography and video games. I like to play first-person shooters, MOBAs,
            and some survival games. My interest in photography comes from a class I took in highschool.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have questions about stuff in Comp Sci or Math I will try to help, as helping others also helps me. :)
