        <p>
            Hello everyone, </br> <!--new line break-->
            My name is Diego Ozuna, I am a senior here at CSUSB and will graduate in December 2024.
            I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I have been on the Dean's
            List since I transferred in FALL 2022. The most interesting field within Computer Science
            for me is Data Science. I want to pursue a career in this field because I want to work closely
            with Machine Learning and AI respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies are film photography and video games. I like to play first-person shooters, MOBAs,
            and some survival games. My interest in photography comes from a class I took in highschool.
        </p>
        <p>
            I usually can be asked questions about stuff in Comp Sci or Math, and I will always try to give an answer only after I investigate
            the topic further. I hope to always provide some insight or some help and in doing so, it also helps me. :)
